<!--
Dari sini terlihat bahwa kontribusi matematika terbanyak terjadi pada abad ke-19 dan 20.

Di abad ke-20, perkembangan matematika terjadi mengikuti perkembangan ilmu fisiika dan sains lainnya.

# Pure Mathematics

Mathematics studied for its intrinsic interest
* Mathematical foundations - *proof theory, set theory, etc.*
* Analysis - *functions, limits, derivatives, integrals, etc.*
* Algebra - *field theory, groups, rings, etc.*
* Geometry
* Topology
* Combinatorics
* Number theory

<!--
* mathematicsl foundations discuss logic and symbols.
* analysis is said to be the language of science itself and is used across chemistry, biology, and physics
* algebra is said to be the study of structure
* geometry deals with spatial relationship using fundamental qualities or axioms
-->

# Applied Mathematics

Mathematical studies that can be directly applied to real-world problems
* Probability and statistics - *statistics, random variables, events, and other mathematical theory of random phenomena*
* Computational sciences - *numerical analysis, algebraic computation, etc.*
* Mathematical physics - *classical & quantum mechanics, mechanics of structures, fluid mechanics, etc.*
* Operation research (OR) - *mathematical modeling, mathematical optimization, statistical analysis, mathematical programming, etc.*

<!--
* probability and stats deal with any random phenomena
* stats can be thought of as the science of making effective use of numerical data from experiments or from populations of individuals
* numerical analysis is the study of iterative methods and algorithms for approximately solving problems to a specified error bound

Briding to next slide:
So there's a lot of type of categorization of areas of mathematics.
Then, where does mathematics actually take place in our daily life? especially, in industry?

# Where does mathematics take place?

It's a mystery for some people.

Hence, to demistify this, let's first take a look from academia perspective.

# How Math Helps (Me)

<!--
Tell a story about how I learned data science, machine learning, and up to this point
* Self-paced learning
* Learning outside formal education, taking online course, researching, reading
* Challenged myself by taking paid internship
* Mathematics is always there as a solid foundation of my learning journey
* Not saying I'm expert at math, I still need to review a lot of basic mathematic laws and concepts
* As long as you have the foundation and eager to learn, then you're probably doing fine
